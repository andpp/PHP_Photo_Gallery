# Simple PHP Photo Gallery

Simple  PHP Photo Gallery - PHP, jQuery, Ajax Photo Gallery No Database 
  
Based on [FolioGallery](http://www.foliopages.com/php-jquery-ajax-photo-gallery-no-database). It is a simple and lightweight gallery that does not require a database to run. 

Difference from original version:

* Added support for subfolders
* On-fly resize images. You can use your original  photo archives without pre-resizing it for web view.
* Speed-up page loading for big image collections
* Moved thumbs to separate folder. The gallery does not require write permissions to albums folders.
* Used [php-image-magician](https://github.com/Oberto/php-image-magician) library for thumbs generation and image on-fly resizing
